### **September 20, 2017: Hurricane Maria Made Landfall In Puerto Rico Causing Immense Damage**

**September 20, 2017: Hurricane Maria Made Landfall In Puerto Rico Causing Immense Damage To The U.S. Territory.** According to NPR, “After devastating parts of the Caribbean, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico early Wednesday as a Category 4 storm packing powerful sustained winds of 155 mph, according to the hurricane center. It is the strongest storm to have hit the U.S. territory in decades.” [NPR, [9/20/17](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/20/552284324/hurricane-maria-makes-landfall-in-puerto-rico)]

#### *The Damage Caused By Hurricane Maria Was Long*-*Term And Devastating*

**Puerto Rico Incurred Roughly $100 Billion In Damages From Hurricane Maria.** According to NBC New York, “On Sept. 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico wreaking havoc across its terrain to such great proportions that very few storms throughout United States history provoked the level of widespread destruction and disorganization experienced during and in the aftermath of Maria. So severe was the impact of the massive storm that the island incurred roughly $100 billion in damages and the effects are still being felt a year later.” [NBC New York, [9/19/18](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/power-is-finally-back-to-all-of-puerto-rico-electric-power-company-announces/527795/)]

**It Took Almost One Year For Power To Be Restored To The Entire Island.** According to NBC New York, “The government-owned electric power company in Puerto Rico announced Tuesday that it officially restored power to the entire island — almost a year after the power grid was severely impacted by Hurricane Maria. According to a tweet by the Puerto Rico Power Authority, or Autoridad de Energia Electrica (AEE) as it is known is Spanish, the utility restored power to its final client in Bo Real Anon in the municipality of Ponce. This final power restoration marks an uphill climb for residents of the island, who faced the longest recorded power outage in United States history — the second worst world-wide.” [NBC New York, [9/19/18](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/power-is-finally-back-to-all-of-puerto-rico-electric-power-company-announces/527795/)]

**A George Washington University Study Revealed That Hurricane Maria Led To A Spike In Mortality, With An Estimated 2,975 Excess Deaths Six Months After The Storm Made Landfall, Attributing Them To Power Outages, Water Insecurity, And Inadequate Infrastructure.** According to the Washington Post, “Hurricane Maria’s devastation in Puerto Rico led to a spike in mortality across the U.S. territory, with an estimated 2,975 excess deaths in the six months after the storm made landfall in September 2017, according to a sweeping report from George Washington University released Tuesday. The government of Puerto Rico on Tuesday embraced the GWU estimate as the official death toll, ranking Maria among the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history […] The spike in mortality came as the territory dealt with widespread and lengthy power outages, a lack of access to adequate health care, water insecurity and diseases related to the crisis.” [Washington Post, [8/28/18](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/study-hurricane-maria-and-its-aftermath-caused-a-spike-in-puerto-rico-deaths-with-nearly-3000-more-than-normal/2018/08/28/57d6d2d6-aa43-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html)]

**A Harvard T.H. Chan School Of Public Health Study Estimated That There Had Been Between 800 And 8,500 Excess Deaths Related To Hurricane Maria.** According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “After Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September 2017, officials initially said that there had been only 16-storm related deaths. But Harvard Chan researchers, along with colleagues in Puerto Rico, estimated that there had actually been between 800 and 8,500 excess deaths related to the hurricane through the end of December 2017.” [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Accessed [2/28/20](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/hurricane-maria-study-popular-paper-2018/)]

#### *The Trump Administration Disputed The Studies And Alleged That Democrats Were Inflating The Death Toll*

**Trump Disputed Official Findings That Nearly 3,000 People Died In Puerto Rico.** According to BBC, “US President Donald Trump is disputing official findings that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of last year's storms. ‘3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,’ Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, without offering evidence for the claim. He accused Democrats of inflating the official death toll to ‘make me look as bad as possible.’ The official figure was released last month after an independent study. On Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted that Democrats were attacking him ‘when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.’” [BBC, [9/13/18](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45511865)]

### **Trump Claimed That Puerto Rico’s Relief Was Hampered By “Big Water, Ocean Water”**

**During A Speech On His Tax Plan, Trump Claimed That Puerto Rico’s Disaster Relief Was Hampered By “Big Water, Ocean Water.”** According to the Hill, “President Trump on Friday said the disaster relief effort in Puerto Rico is complicated because it is ‘surrounded by water.’ ‘This is an island, surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water,’ the president said during a speech in Washington on his tax plan. The comments come as Trump has come under fire for his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria. Trump has repeatedly cited Puerto Rico’s location as a hurdle toward a speedier recovery. The storm devastated much of the island and left many of its citizens without food, water and electricity. Critics have said the administration provided quicker and more effective disaster relief to Texas, Florida and other mainland states hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, a charge officials deny.” [The Hill, [9/29/17](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353094-trump-says-puerto-rico-relief-hampered-by-big-water-ocean-water)]

### **Government Records Revealed That The Trump Administration Exerted More Effort Towards Disaster Relief In Texas Compared To Those In Puerto Rico After Maria**

#### *September 26, 2017: Trump Failed To Waive Shipping Restriction to Aid Puerto Rico’s Recovery Efforts* 

**September 26, 2017: The Trump Administration Failed To Waive Shipping Restrictions To Help Get Fuel And Supplies To Puerto Rico.** According to Reuters, “The Trump administration on Tuesday said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, because it would do nothing to address the island’s main impediment to shipping, damaged ports. The Jones Act limits shipping between coasts to U.S. flagged vessels. However, in the wake of brutal storms, the government has occasionally issued temporary waivers to allow the use of cheaper, tax free or more readily available foreign-flagged ships. The Department of Homeland Security, which waived the act after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, did not agree an exemption would help this time.” [Reuters, [9/26/17](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-shipping/u-s-denies-request-for-puerto-rico-shipping-waiver-idUSKCN1C12UI)]

##### *The Jones Act Was A Shipping Regulation, Often Waived In Disasters, That Made Essentials More Expensive For Puerto Rico* 

**The Jones Act Was An Obscure Shipping Regulation That Made The Shipment Of Basic Essentials Needed For Disaster Recovery More Expensive For Puerto Rico.** According to Reuters, “Puerto Rico has long railed against the Jones Act, saying it makes the cost of imported basic commodities, such as food, clothing and fuel, more expensive […] ‘It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster,’ [Senator John] McCain said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.” [Reuters, [9/26/17](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-shipping/u-s-denies-request-for-puerto-rico-shipping-waiver-idUSKCN1C12UI)]

**The Jones Act Is Often Waived In A Disaster.** According to Vox, “But the executive branch has the authority to waive the act in special circumstances, as it has done in the past whenever the downside of making it excessively expensive to ship American goods from one place in America to another becomes a high-profile issue. The Bush administration issued Jones Act waivers after Hurricanes Katrina and Hurricane to speed the shipment of fuel to the Gulf Coast. The Obama administration issued a more limited waiver after Hurricane Sandy, again to speed the shipment of fuel. On September 8, the Trump administration issued Jones Act waivers for areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey.” [Vox, [9/27/17](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/27/16373484/jones-act-puerto-rico)]

#### *Two Days Later, Trump Changed His Mind And Waived The Jones Act* 

**September 28, 2017: Trump Waived The Jones Act For Puerto Rico, Easing Hurricane Aid Shipments**. According to the New York Times, “The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would temporarily waive a century-old shipping law for Puerto Rico that officials there said was hindering disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. The waiver of the law, known as the Jones Act, comes as federal and local officials report more supplies trickling onto the increasingly desperate island. But the Trump administration remains under pressure to step up the recovery effort.” [New York Times, [9/28/17](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/us/jones-act-waived.html)] 

**Trump Claimed That “Puerto Rico Should Love President Trump” After He Signed The Bill Even Though Trump Initially Did Not Want To Give More Relief Funds To The Territory.** According to CNBC, “‘Just signed Disaster Aid Bill to help Americans who have been hit by recent catastrophic storms,’ Trump tweeted on Thursday along with a photo of him holding a signed document. ‘So important for our GREAT American farmers and ranchers.’ He also contended that ‘Puerto Rico should love President Trump.’ The president claimed the island ‘would have been shut out’ without him. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. The storm knocked out power for 1.5 million people and it took 11 months to restore it. The island’s government estimated the hurricane caused nearly 3,000 deaths. Trump’s response to the devastation on the island has been widely criticized. Congress failed to approve the aid money quickly in no small part because Trump did not want to give more relief funds to the U.S. territory.” [CNBC, [6/6/19](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/06/trump-signs-natural-disaster-relief-bill-for-puerto-rico-and-states.html)]

#### *Trump Privately Vented About Federal Aid To Puerto Rico*

**The Trump Administration Imposed Severe Restrictions On The $16 Billion In Funding Going To Puerto Rico.** According to the New York Times, “The Trump administration imposed severe restrictions on Wednesday on billions of dollars in emergency relief to Puerto Rico, including blocking spending on the island’s electrical grid and suspending its $15-an-hour minimum wage for federally funded relief work. The nearly $16 billion in funding, released while Puerto Ricans still sleep on the streets for fear of aftershocks from last week’s earthquake, is part of $20 billion that Congress allocated for disaster recovery and preparation more than a year ago, in response to the commonwealth being hit by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

#### *Amid Rolling Blackouts, Trump Placed Restrictions On Funding Towards Puerto Rico’s Electrical Grid*

**Although Puerto Rico Continued To Be Plagued By Rolling Blackouts, Trump Imposed A Restriction That Barred The Territory From Using The Funds On The Electrical Grid.** According to the New York Times, “Puerto Rico will be barred from paying its $15-an-hour minimum wage to workers on federally funded projects. And none of the funds can be used on the electrical grid, although the Department of Housing and Urban Development has yet to release nearly $2 billion that was allocated for Puerto Rico’s electrical system. White House officials acknowledged that rolling blackouts continue in Puerto Rico but insisted there was no need for new money […] A congressional aide involved in the issue said the White House and its budget office appeared to have chosen restrictions that would be politically difficult for Puerto Rican officials to carry out. That way, the aide suggested, the federal government would not appear responsible for withholding the aid.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

**Congress Approved Separate Funds For The Electrical Grid That Had Not Been Allocated.** According to the New York Times, “The restriction relating to the electrical grid may just be a practical one: Congress has already appropriated a separate tranche of money specifically for the electrical grid, though it has yet to be allocated.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

#### *The Washington Post Reported That Two Years Prior, A Power Company With “Just Two Full-Time Employees” Tied To Then Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke “Signed A $300 Million Contract With The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority”*

**Washington Post: A Power Company With “Just Two Full-Time Employees” That Was Based Out Of Ryan Zinke’s Hometown Of Whitefish, Montana “Signed A $300 Million Contract With The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.”** According to the Washington Post, “For the sprawling effort to restore Puerto Rico’s crippled electrical grid, the territory’s state-owned utility has turned to a two-year-old company from Montana that had just two full-time employees on the day Hurricane Maria made landfall. The company, Whitefish Energy, said last week that it had signed a $300 million contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to repair and reconstruct large portions of the island’s electrical infrastructure. The contract is the biggest yet issued in the troubled relief effort. […] Whitefish Energy is based in Whitefish, Mont., the home town of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.” [Washington Post, [10/23/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-montana-firm-lands-puerto-ricos-biggest-contract-to-get-the-power-back-on/2017/10/23/31cccc3e-b4d6-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.df96d5b2310f)]

#### *Zinke’s Office Said He Had No Role In Whitefish Securing The Contract*

**Zinke’s Office Said He Had No Role In Whitefish Securing The Contract.** According to the Washington Post, “Whitefish Energy is based in Whitefish, Mont., the home town of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Its chief executive, Andy Techmanski, and Zinke acknowledge knowing one another — but only, Zinke’s office said in an email, because Whitefish is a small town where ‘everybody knows everybody.’ One of Zinke’s sons ‘joined a friend who worked a summer job’ at one of Techmanski’s construction sites, the email said. Whitefish said he worked as a ‘flagger.’ Zinke’s office said he had no role in Whitefish securing the contract for work in Puerto Rico. Techmanski also said Zinke was not involved.” [Washington Post, [10/23/17](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/small-montana-firm-lands-puerto-ricos-biggest-contract-to-get-the-power-back-on/2017/10/23/31cccc3e-b4d6-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.df96d5b2310f)]

**NPR: Whitefish’s Contract Showed “Pricey” Labor Rates Of $240 Per Hour For Foremen And $227 Per Hour For Linemen.** According to NPR, “Much of the controversy that has surrounded the contract has focused on the high rates Whitefish is charging for labor. The contract shows those labor rates are pricey indeed: $240 an hour for a general foreman and $227 for a lineman.” [NPR, [10/27/17](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/27/560422492/heres-what-s-in-that-300-million-whitefish-contract)]

They say that Education Department staff members would be discouraged from opening cases and that investigations could be weakened because efficiency would take priority over thoroughness. ‘If we want to have assembly-line justice, and I say ‘justice’ in quotes, then that’s the direction that we should go,’ said Catherine Lhamon, who was the assistant secretary of the Education Department’s civil rights office under Mr. Obama, and who now heads the United States Commission on Civil Rights.” [New York Times, [*6/16/17*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/education-department-civil-rights-betsy-devos.html?_r=0)]

##### *The Nonpartisan U.S. Commission On Civil Rights Stated They Had ‘‘Grave Concerns’’ About The Administration’s Priorities*

**The Nonpartisan U.S. Commission On Civil Rights Said They Had ‘‘Grave Concerns’’ That The Protection And Fulfillment Of Civil Rights Would “Not Be Appropriately Prioritized.’’** According to the Michigan Chronicle, “On June 16, the nonpartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights weighed in on proposed cuts and issued a lengthy statement detailing a new two-year, comprehensive assessment of federal civil rights enforcement. In part the statement read, ‘The review will examine the degree to which current budgets and staffing levels allow civil rights offices to perform their statutory and regulatory functions.’ The Commission has grave concerns about continuing signals from the current Administration, including the President's proposed budget and statements of Cabinet and senior Administration officials, that the protection and fulfillment of civil rights of all persons will not be appropriately prioritized,’ continued the Commission statement. ‘These proposed cuts are particularly troubling in light of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' repeated refusal in Congressional testimony and other public statements to commit that the Department would enforce federal civil rights laws.’” [Michigan Chronicle, [*7/12/17*](https://issuu.com/michronicle/docs/mc_digital_edition_7-12-17)]

### **September 2017: DeVos Rescinded Obama Administration’s Directive On Sexual Assault Investigations**

**September 22, 2017: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Rescinded Obama-Era Guidance On School Sexual Assault.** According to Politico, “Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced Friday she was rescinding Obama-era guidance on school sexual assault, effective immediately. The agency issued a question-and-answer document to help schools navigate the highly contentious issue while a formal review is conducted. The document allows schools to use a higher standard of proof in campus disciplinary proceedings related to sexual violence, altering one of the most hotly debated elements of the Obama-era guidance. Instead, schools can opt to use a higher standard of proof — known as ‘clear and convincing evidence.’” [Politico, [*9/22/17*](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/obama-era-school-sexual-assault-policy-rescinded-243016)]

**July 2017: Trump’s Education Secretary Met With Men Accused Of Campus Sexual Assault; The Men Who Met With The Education Secretary Claimed The Meetings Were ‘‘Uplifting.’’** According to Time, “Men who say they were falsely accused of sexual assault and harassment in college left their meeting with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday feeling encouraged that a government official had seen their side of the story, they said. But advocates for sexual assault victims who met separately with DeVos on the same day had the opposite reaction, leaving with deep concerns about how the Education Department is approaching the issue of sexual violence on campus and fears that it could roll back more stringent guidelines implemented by the Obama administration […] Jonathon Andrews — who said he was falsely accused of sexual assault by two members of his Hanover College fraternity in 2015, after one of them sexually assaulted him — participated in one of the three meetings DeVos held Thursday. ‘It was very uplifting to me. It was a moment where you felt like you were finally being seen,’ he said.” [Time, [*7/16/17*](https://time.com/4857377/betsy-devos-campus-sexual-assault-meeting/)]

**DeVos Met With A Man Worked As An Advocate For SAVE Otherwise Known As Stop Abusive And Violent Environments.** According to Time, “Andrews, 23, works with Stop Abusive and Violent Environments (SAVE), a nonprofit group that advocates to lawmakers and university officials for the due process rights of those accused of sexual assault. The group was labeled misogynistic by the Southern Poverty Law Center after it published a set of ‘key facts’ about domestic violence that said ‘female initiation of partner violence is the leading reason for the woman becoming a victim of subsequent injury.’” [Time, [*7/16/17*](https://time.com/4857377/betsy-devos-campus-sexual-assault-meeting/)]

##### *Women’s Groups And Victim Advocates Stated The Changes Would Be “Devastating” To Survivors Of Sexual Assault*

**President And CEO Of The National Women’s Law Center Stated That The Rule Changes Could Be “Devastating” To Survivors Of Sexual Assault.** According to Politico, “But Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said the effects of the change could be ‘devastating’ to victims of sexual assault. ‘It will discourage students from reporting assaults, create uncertainty for schools on how to follow the law and make campuses less safe,’ Graves said. One footnote, she said, is particularly confusing. That footnote says, ‘The standard of evidence for evaluating a claim of sexual misconduct should be consistent with the standard the school applies in other student misconduct cases.’ Goss Graves said that seems to suggest the standard of evidence used for evaluating cases of sexual misconduct should be the same as the evidence used to evaluate cases of cheating or plagiarism. Colleges and universities should have different priorities when it comes to evaluating cases of sexual assault, she said.” [Politico, [*9/22/17*](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/obama-era-school-sexual-assault-policy-rescinded-243016)]

**Leader Of The Advocacy Organization Know Your IX Stated That The Mediation Element In The Trump Administration’s Rules Would Prove Harmful To Survivors Of Sexual Assault.** According to Politico, “In another new element, the new instructions will allow campuses to provide mediation in sexual assault cases if both sides agree to it — an option not permitted under the Obama-era guidance which pushed school leaders to combat sexual harassment, including sexual violence […] Alyssa Peterson, policy and advocacy coordinator for the victim’s advocacy organization Know Your IX, said the change on mediation is perhaps ‘the most frightening part of this for me.’ ‘It’s very intimidating for a victim to participate in a mediation session with their rapist,’ she said, and schools might not be the best ones to facilitate such a session.” [Politico, [*9/22/17*](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/obama-era-school-sexual-assault-policy-rescinded-243016)]

##### *Survivors’ Advocates Decried The Trump Administration’s Emphasis On Those Accused Of Sexual Assault*

**Survivors’ Advocates Condemned The Trump Administration’s Emphasis On Accused Students.** According to the Washington Post, “Survivors' advocates decried DeVos's emphasis on wrongly accused students as out of step with reality, saying only a fraction of rape reports are found to be false. The criticism only intensified after Candice Jackson, acting head of Education's civil rights office, told the New York Times in July that ‘90 percent’ of campus sexual assaults were really drunken, regretted sex. Jackson later apologized for her statement, saying she had been ‘flippant,’ but the remark spurred a torrent of calls for her resignation or removal. For years, victims and advocates complained that university officials would prefer to ignore allegations of rape and sexual assault to avoid either bad publicity for the institution or getting mired in complicated, difficult-to-prove cases. The Obama administration pushed colleges to do better - to respond more quickly and more comprehensively, resolve the complaints and protect students who reported sexual assaults. And it did so with real force: the threat of withholding federal funding to schools that did not comply.” [Washington Post, [*9/7/17*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/09/07/protesters-gather-anticipating-devos-speech-on-campus-sexual-assault/)]

##### *LGBTQ Advocacy Groups Stated That Trump Administration Was Undermining Survivors’ “While Simultaneously Ignoring The LGBTQ Community”*

**The Trevor Project Condemned Trump’s Education Department For Undermining Sexual Assault Survivors “While Simultaneously Ignoring The LGBTQ Community.”** According to a Trevor Project press release, “The Education Secretary discussed suicide attempts at length in her speech today yet with her actions she is creating irreparable harm and putting LGBTQ students at higher risk of suicidal ideation. She is taking national policy in the wrong direction, sending a message that undermines victims of sexual assault while simultaneously ignoring the LGBTQ community. Although no studies have been conducted specifically about LGBTQ college sexual assault survivors and suicidality, we know that LGBTQ youth in general are 3-4x more likely to attempt suicide and that sexual assault survivors are at greater risk of considering and attempting suicide. DeVos's statement sends a dangerous message to victims that their complaints aren't believed. Moreover, by discussing this issue in strictly 'women versus men' terms, she strongly reinforces the hetero and cissexist systems that can be barriers to LGBTQ students seeking help.” [Trevor Project, [*9/7/17*](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/09/prweb14674557.htm)]
