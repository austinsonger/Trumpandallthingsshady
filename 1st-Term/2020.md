#### **January 15, 2020: Trump Imposed Severe Restrictions On Aid Including Blocking Spending On The Islands Electrical Grid**

**Although Puerto Rico Continued To Be Plagued By Rolling Blackouts, Trump Imposed A Restriction That Barred The Territory From Using The Funds On The Electrical Grid.** According to the New York Times, “Puerto Rico will be barred from paying its $15-an-hour minimum wage to workers on federally funded projects. And none of the funds can be used on the electrical grid, although the Department of Housing and Urban Development has yet to release nearly $2 billion that was allocated for Puerto Rico’s electrical system. White House officials acknowledged that rolling blackouts continue in Puerto Rico but insisted there was no need for new money […] A congressional aide involved in the issue said the White House and its budget office appeared to have chosen restrictions that would be politically difficult for Puerto Rican officials to carry out. That way, the aide suggested, the federal government would not appear responsible for withholding the aid.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

**Congress Approved Separate Funds For The Electrical Grid That Had Not Been Allocated.** According to the New York Times, “The restriction relating to the electrical grid may just be a practical one: Congress has already appropriated a separate tranche of money specifically for the electrical grid, though it has yet to be allocated.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

##### *The Washington Post Reported That Two Years Prior, A Power Company With “Just Two Full-Time Employees” Tied To Then Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke “Signed A $300 Million Contract With The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority”*

**Jayson O’Neill Deputy Director Of The Western Values Project: You Cannot Log Or Even “Rake Your Way Out Of This Mess.”** According to the Guardian, “Jayson O’Neill, the deputy director of the Western Values Project, said the emails are another example of the administration ‘trying to find ways to tell a story to achieve industry goals.’ ‘As wildfire experts have repeatedly explained, you can’t log or even ‘rake’ our way out of this mess,’ O’Neill said. ‘The Trump administration and the interior department are pushing mystical theories that are false in order to justify gutting public land protections to advance their pro-industry and lobbyist dominated agenda.’” [Guardian, [1/24/20](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/trump-administration-wildfire-science-promote-logging-california-emissions)]
