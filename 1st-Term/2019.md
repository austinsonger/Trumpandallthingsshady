## Disaster Relief

**Census Bureau: 130,000 Left Puerto Rico After Hurricane Maria Nearly 4% Of The Population.** According to CNN, “An estimated 130,000 people -- almost 4% of the population -- left the island of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, according to data released Wednesday by the US Census Bureau. ‘It's a really large number -- and it's a number that's well above what we've seen in the past,’ Alexis Santos, a demographer a Penn State University, said of the population decrease. ‘Here, what you're looking at is double -- double the displacement we would have expected’ in a normal year.” [CNN, [12/19/18](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/19/health/sutter-puerto-rico-census-update/index.html)]

#### **Two University Studies Attributed Thousands Of Excess Deaths To The Aftermath Of Hurricane Maria** 

**Government Records Revealed That The Trump Administration Exerted More Effort Towards Disaster Relief In Texas Compared To Those In Puerto Rico.** According to Politico, “No two hurricanes are alike, and Harvey and Maria were vastly different storms that struck areas with vastly different financial, geographic and political situations. But a comparison of government statistics relating to the two recovery efforts strongly supports the views of disaster-recovery experts that FEMA and the Trump administration exerted a faster, and initially greater, effort in Texas, even though the damage in Puerto Rico exceeded that in Houston.” [Politico, [3/27/18](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/27/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-maria-response-480557)]

**Nine Days After Hurricane Harvey, FEMA Approved $141.8 Million In Assistance, Compared To Just $6.2 Million In Assistance For Hurricane Maria Victims.** According to Politico, “Nine days after the respective hurricanes, FEMA had approved $141.8 million in individual assistance to Harvey victims, versus just $6.2 million for Maria victims.” [Politico, [3/27/18](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/27/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-maria-response-480557)]

##### *FEMA Delivered Fewer Supplies To Puerto Rico Than Texas In The Same Time Period* 

**FEMA Delivered Few Supplies To Puerto Rico In The First Nine Days Following Maria And Failed To Approve Permanent Disaster Relief Work In Puerto Rico In A Timely Manner.** According to Politico, “During the first nine days after Harvey, FEMA provided 5.1 million meals, 4.5 million liters of water and over 20,000 tarps to Houston; but in the same period, it delivered just 1.6 million meals, 2.8 million liters of water and roughly 5,000 tarps to Puerto Rico […] It took just 10 days for FEMA to approve permanent disaster work for Texas, compared with 43 days for Puerto Rico.” [Politico, [3/27/18](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/27/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-maria-response-480557)]

##### *It Took Weeks For FEMA And The Department Of Defense To Increase Their Forces In Puerto Rico*

**It Took Weeks For FEMA And The Defense Department To Increase Forces In Puerto Rico Even Though The Airports And Ports Were Open.** According to Politico, “But it still took weeks for FEMA and the Department of Defense to increase their forces in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, even though the main airports and ports were opened within a few days. Disaster-recovery experts also faulted the government for failing to direct the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships, which have their own fleets of helicopters and were deployed off the coast for Florida to help with Hurricane Irma in early September, to help with the response efforts to Hurricane Maria. The Lincoln began to position itself to help with Irma two days before the storm hit Florida. FEMA never requested that the Department of Defense send the Lincoln to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.” [Politico, [3/27/20](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/27/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-maria-response-480557)]

#### **Trump Waffled On Providing A Waiver To Help Get Emergency Relief To Puerto Rico**

**FEMA Gave An Entrepreneur With No Experience In Disaster Relief And At Least Five Canceled Government Contracts A $156 Million Contract To Provide 30 Million Meals To Puerto Rico.** According to the New York Times, “The mission for the Federal Emergency Management Agency was clear: Hurricane Maria had torn through Puerto Rico, and hungry people needed food. Thirty million meals needed to be delivered as soon as possible. For this huge task, FEMA tapped Tiffany Brown, an Atlanta entrepreneur with no experience in large-scale disaster relief and at least five canceled government contracts in her past. FEMA awarded her $156 million for the job, and Ms. Brown, who is the sole owner and employee of her company, Tribute Contracting LLC, set out to find some help.” [New York Times, [2/6/18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/fema-contract-puerto-rico.html)]

**When 18.5 Million Meals Were Due, Brown Had Delivered Only 50,000.** According to the New York Times, “By the time 18.5 million meals were due, Tribute had delivered only 50,000. And FEMA inspectors discovered a problem: The food had been packaged separately from the pouches used to heat them. FEMA’s solicitation required ‘self-heating meals.’ ‘Do not ship another meal. Your contract is terminated,’ Carolyn Ward, the FEMA contracting officer who handled Tribute’s agreement, wrote to Ms. Brown in an email dated Oct. 19 that Ms. Brown provided to The New York Times. ‘This is a logistical nightmare.’” [New York Times, [2/6/18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/fema-contract-puerto-rico.html)]

##### *Puerto Rico Has Struggled With Access To Food*

**In The Aftermath Of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico Struggled With Access To Food.** According to the New York Times, “FEMA insists no Puerto Ricans missed a meal as a result of the failed agreement with Tribute. FEMA relied on other suppliers that provided ‘ample’ food and water for distribution, said William Booher, an agency spokesman. But there is little doubt that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans struggled with access to food. The storm shut down ports on an island that imports about 85 percent of its food supply. Farms were flattened. Supermarkets lost electricity and could not find diesel to run their generators. The stores that opened using generator power could not offer much from their understocked shelves. Puerto Ricans depended heavily on emergency aid dispatched by FEMA.” [New York Times, [2/6/18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/us/fema-contract-puerto-rico.html)] 

#### **FEMA Gave A $30 Million Contract For Tarps, But The Tarps Never Arrived In Puerto Rico**

**Brock Long, Trump’s Director Of FEMA, Wrote An Op-Ed Declaring That The Agency Was Not A First Responder.** According to a USA Today op-ed by Brock Long, “FEMA is not a first responder; disasters are state managed, locally executed and federally supported. Our role is to support local governments following a disaster only after their capacity to respond has been exceeded.” [USA Today – Op-Ed – Brock Long, [5/31/18](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/31/fema-supports-puerto-rico-government-editorials-debates/35556537/)]

**Trump Said The Coast Guard Rescued People Who “Went Out On Their Boats To Watch” Harvey.** According to CNN, “President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that a main reason the US Coast Guard was so busy rescuing people during Hurricane Harvey was that people were watching the storm on boats. But local officials -- including the state's Republican governor -- have no idea what he's talking about The Coast Guard ‘saved 16,000 people, many of them in Texas, for whatever reason that is,’ Trump said during a visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters for a briefing on hurricane season. He added, ‘People went out in their boats to watch the hurricane. That didn't work out too well.’” [CNN, [6/7/18](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/politics/donald-trump-fema-hurricane-harvey/index.html)]

Rice said. ‘In my view, this shameful attack on California is an attack on all our courageous men and women on the front lines.’ Rice also said Trump's assertion that California's forest management policies are to blame ‘is dangerously wrong.’ ‘Wildfires are sparked and spread not only in forested areas but in populated areas and open fields fueled by parched vegetation, high winds, low humidity and geography,’ he said.” [CNN, [11/11/18](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/11/politics/california-wildfires-trump-tweets/index.html)]

#### **Trump Administration Sought To Expand Logging In California**

**The Trump Administration Used The Wildfires To Push To Reopen And Log In Public Lands Including The Los Padres National Forest North Of Los Angeles, Claiming That Logging Would Reduce Fire Risk.** According to the Los Angeles Times, “Logging has long been among California’s most divisive environmental issues — and the controversy shows little chance of cooling as the Trump administration pushes new efforts to thin forests. The federal government is moving to allow commercial logging of healthy green pine trees for the first time in decades in the Los Padres National Forest north of Los Angeles, a tactic the U.S. Forest Services says will reduce fire risk. It’s an idea President Trump appeared to endorse in tweets inaccurately linking wildfire to state water management […] The Trump administration is seeking to reopen some of the most sensitive and sought-after public lands in the state not just for timber production, but also for potential solar, wind, broadband infrastructure, mining, off-road vehicle and grazing uses. When it comes to timber, the justification is fire prevention. Environmental groups have long argued that the logging industry has used fire as an excuse to plunder forests, cutting big trees and leaving behind only small, unmarketable timber.” [Los Angeles Times, [8/7/18](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-logging-wildfire-risk-20180807-story.html)]

**Critics Argued That His Executive Order Was An Administration Gift To The Logging Industry.** According to the Sacramento Bee, “Environmental groups blasted Trump’s order.

All the fire ecologists are saying the same thing: You can’t log your way out of this situation,’ Boggs said. ‘Logging in the back country is just a gift to the timber industry.’ Boggs said environmentalists will certainly sue if Trump tries to ramp up logging. Since taking office, the Trump administration has advocated for more aggressive timber management to boost struggling rural economies and to proactively fight fires.

The messaging plan was crafted in support of Donald Trump’s pro-industry arguments for harvesting more timber in California, which he says would thin forests and prevent fires – a point experts refute. The emails show officials seeking to estimate the carbon emissions from devastating 2018 fires in California so they could compare them to the carbon footprint of the state’s electricity sector and then publish statements encouraging cutting down trees.” [Guardian, [1/24/20](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/trump-administration-wildfire-science-promote-logging-california-emissions)]
