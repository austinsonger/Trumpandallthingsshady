**September 20, 2017: Hurricane Maria Made Landfall In Puerto Rico Causing Immense Damage To The U.S. Territory.** According to NPR, “After devastating parts of the Caribbean, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico early Wednesday as a Category 4 storm packing powerful sustained winds of 155 mph, according to the hurricane center. It is the strongest storm to have hit the U.S. territory in decades.” [NPR, [9/20/17](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/20/552284324/hurricane-maria-makes-landfall-in-puerto-rico)]

##### *The Damage Caused By Hurricane Maria Was Long*-*Term And Devastating*

**Puerto Rico Incurred Roughly $100 Billion In Damages From Hurricane Maria.** According to NBC New York, “On Sept. 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico wreaking havoc across its terrain to such great proportions that very few storms throughout United States history provoked the level of widespread destruction and disorganization experienced during and in the aftermath of Maria. So severe was the impact of the massive storm that the island incurred roughly $100 billion in damages and the effects are still being felt a year later.” [NBC New York, [9/19/18](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/power-is-finally-back-to-all-of-puerto-rico-electric-power-company-announces/527795/)]

**It Took Almost One Year For Power To Be Restored To The Entire Island.** According to NBC New York, “The government-owned electric power company in Puerto Rico announced Tuesday that it officially restored power to the entire island — almost a year after the power grid was severely impacted by Hurricane Maria. According to a tweet by the Puerto Rico Power Authority, or Autoridad de Energia Electrica (AEE) as it is known is Spanish, the utility restored power to its final client in Bo Real Anon in the municipality of Ponce. This final power restoration marks an uphill climb for residents of the island, who faced the longest recorded power outage in United States history — the second worst world-wide.” [NBC New York, [9/19/18](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/power-is-finally-back-to-all-of-puerto-rico-electric-power-company-announces/527795/)]

**A George Washington University Study Revealed That Hurricane Maria Led To A Spike In Mortality, With An Estimated 2,975 Excess Deaths Six Months After The Storm Made Landfall, Attributing Them To Power Outages, Water Insecurity, And Inadequate Infrastructure.** According to the Washington Post, “Hurricane Maria’s devastation in Puerto Rico led to a spike in mortality across the U.S. territory, with an estimated 2,975 excess deaths in the six months after the storm made landfall in September 2017, according to a sweeping report from George Washington University released Tuesday. The government of Puerto Rico on Tuesday embraced the GWU estimate as the official death toll, ranking Maria among the deadliest natural disasters in U.S. history […] The spike in mortality came as the territory dealt with widespread and lengthy power outages, a lack of access to adequate health care, water insecurity and diseases related to the crisis.” [Washington Post, [8/28/18](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/study-hurricane-maria-and-its-aftermath-caused-a-spike-in-puerto-rico-deaths-with-nearly-3000-more-than-normal/2018/08/28/57d6d2d6-aa43-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html)]

**A Harvard T.H. Chan School Of Public Health Study Estimated That There Had Been Between 800 And 8,500 Excess Deaths Related To Hurricane Maria.** According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “After Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September 2017, officials initially said that there had been only 16-storm related deaths. But Harvard Chan researchers, along with colleagues in Puerto Rico, estimated that there had actually been between 800 and 8,500 excess deaths related to the hurricane through the end of December 2017.” [Harvard T.H.

##### *The Trump Administration Disputed The Studies And Alleged That Democrats Were Inflating The Death Toll*

**Trump Disputed Official Findings That Nearly 3,000 People Died In Puerto Rico.** According to BBC, “US President Donald Trump is disputing official findings that nearly 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of last year's storms. ‘3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico,’ Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, without offering evidence for the claim. He accused Democrats of inflating the official death toll to ‘make me look as bad as possible.’ The official figure was released last month after an independent study. On Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted that Democrats were attacking him ‘when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.’” [BBC, [9/13/18](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45511865)]

#### **Trump Claimed That Puerto Rico’s Relief Was Hampered By “Big Water, Ocean Water”**

**During A Speech On His Tax Plan, Trump Claimed That Puerto Rico’s Disaster Relief Was Hampered By “Big Water, Ocean Water.”** According to the Hill, “President Trump on Friday said the disaster relief effort in Puerto Rico is complicated because it is ‘surrounded by water.’ ‘This is an island, surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water,’ the president said during a speech in Washington on his tax plan. The comments come as Trump has come under fire for his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria. Trump has repeatedly cited Puerto Rico’s location as a hurdle toward a speedier recovery. The storm devastated much of the island and left many of its citizens without food, water and electricity. Critics have said the administration provided quicker and more effective disaster relief to Texas, Florida and other mainland states hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, a charge officials deny.” [The Hill, [9/29/17](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353094-trump-says-puerto-rico-relief-hampered-by-big-water-ocean-water)]

#### **Government Records Revealed That The Trump Administration Exerted More Effort Towards Disaster Relief In Texas Compared To Those In Puerto Rico After Maria**

##### *September 26, 2017: Trump Failed To Waive Shipping Restriction to Aid Puerto Rico’s Recovery Efforts* 

**September 26, 2017: The Trump Administration Failed To Waive Shipping Restrictions To Help Get Fuel And Supplies To Puerto Rico.** According to Reuters, “The Trump administration on Tuesday said there was no need to waive shipping restrictions to help get fuel and supplies to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, because it would do nothing to address the island’s main impediment to shipping, damaged ports. The Jones Act limits shipping between coasts to U.S. flagged vessels. However, in the wake of brutal storms, the government has occasionally issued temporary waivers to allow the use of cheaper, tax free or more readily available foreign-flagged ships. The Department of Homeland Security, which waived the act after hurricanes Harvey and Irma, did not agree an exemption would help this time.” [Reuters, [9/26/17](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-shipping/u-s-denies-request-for-puerto-rico-shipping-waiver-idUSKCN1C12UI)]

###### *The Jones Act Was A Shipping Regulation, Often Waived In Disasters, That Made Essentials More Expensive For Puerto Rico* 

**The Jones Act Was An Obscure Shipping Regulation That Made The Shipment Of Basic Essentials Needed For Disaster Recovery More Expensive For Puerto Rico.** According to Reuters, “Puerto Rico has long railed against the Jones Act, saying it makes the cost of imported basic commodities, such as food, clothing and fuel, more expensive […] ‘It is unacceptable to force the people of Puerto Rico to pay at least twice as much for food, clean drinking water, supplies and infrastructure due to Jones Act requirements as they work to recover from this disaster,’ [Senator John] McCain said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.” [Reuters, [9/26/17](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria-puertorico-shipping/u-s-denies-request-for-puerto-rico-shipping-waiver-idUSKCN1C12UI)]

**The Jones Act Is Often Waived In A Disaster.** According to Vox, “But the executive branch has the authority to waive the act in special circumstances, as it has done in the past whenever the downside of making it excessively expensive to ship American goods from one place in America to another becomes a high-profile issue. The Bush administration issued Jones Act waivers after Hurricanes Katrina and Hurricane to speed the shipment of fuel to the Gulf Coast. The Obama administration issued a more limited waiver after Hurricane Sandy, again to speed the shipment of fuel. On September 8, the Trump administration issued Jones Act waivers for areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey.” [Vox, [9/27/17](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/27/16373484/jones-act-puerto-rico)]

##### *Two Days Later, Trump Changed His Mind And Waived The Jones Act* 

**September 28, 2017: Trump Waived The Jones Act For Puerto Rico, Easing Hurricane Aid Shipments**. According to the New York Times, “The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would temporarily waive a century-old shipping law for Puerto Rico that officials there said was hindering disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Maria. The waiver of the law, known as the Jones Act, comes as federal and local officials report more supplies trickling onto the increasingly desperate island. But the Trump administration remains under pressure to step up the recovery effort.” [New York Times, [9/28/17](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/us/jones-act-waived.html)] 

**Trump Claimed That “Puerto Rico Should Love President Trump” After He Signed The Bill Even Though Trump Initially Did Not Want To Give More Relief Funds To The Territory.** According to CNBC, “‘Just signed Disaster Aid Bill to help Americans who have been hit by recent catastrophic storms,’ Trump tweeted on Thursday along with a photo of him holding a signed document. ‘So important for our GREAT American farmers and ranchers.’ He also contended that ‘Puerto Rico should love President Trump.’ The president claimed the island ‘would have been shut out’ without him. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. The storm knocked out power for 1.5 million people and it took 11 months to restore it. The island’s government estimated the hurricane caused nearly 3,000 deaths. Trump’s response to the devastation on the island has been widely criticized. Congress failed to approve the aid money quickly in no small part because Trump did not want to give more relief funds to the U.S. territory.” [CNBC, [6/6/19](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/06/trump-signs-natural-disaster-relief-bill-for-puerto-rico-and-states.html)]

##### *Trump Privately Vented About Federal Aid To Puerto Rico*

**The Trump Administration Imposed Severe Restrictions On The $16 Billion In Funding Going To Puerto Rico.** According to the New York Times, “The Trump administration imposed severe restrictions on Wednesday on billions of dollars in emergency relief to Puerto Rico, including blocking spending on the island’s electrical grid and suspending its $15-an-hour minimum wage for federally funded relief work. The nearly $16 billion in funding, released while Puerto Ricans still sleep on the streets for fear of aftershocks from last week’s earthquake, is part of $20 billion that Congress allocated for disaster recovery and preparation more than a year ago, in response to the commonwealth being hit by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

##### *Amid Rolling Blackouts, Trump Placed Restrictions On Funding Towards Puerto Rico’s Electrical Grid*

**Although Puerto Rico Continued To Be Plagued By Rolling Blackouts, Trump Imposed A Restriction That Barred The Territory From Using The Funds On The Electrical Grid.** According to the New York Times, “Puerto Rico will be barred from paying its $15-an-hour minimum wage to workers on federally funded projects. And none of the funds can be used on the electrical grid, although the Department of Housing and Urban Development has yet to release nearly $2 billion that was allocated for Puerto Rico’s electrical system. White House officials acknowledged that rolling blackouts continue in Puerto Rico but insisted there was no need for new money […] A congressional aide involved in the issue said the White House and its budget office appeared to have chosen restrictions that would be politically difficult for Puerto Rican officials to carry out. That way, the aide suggested, the federal government would not appear responsible for withholding the aid.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

**Congress Approved Separate Funds For The Electrical Grid That Had Not Been Allocated.** According to the New York Times, “The restriction relating to the electrical grid may just be a practical one: Congress has already appropriated a separate tranche of money specifically for the electrical grid, though it has yet to be allocated.” [New York Times, [1/15/20](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-disaster-aid.html)]

##### *The Washington Post Reported That Two Years Prior, A Power Company With “Just Two Full-Time Employees” Tied To Then Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke “Signed A $300 Million Contract With The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority”*

**Washington Post: A Power Company With “Just Two Full-Time Employees” That Was Based Out Of Ryan Zinke’s Hometown Of Whitefish, Montana “Signed A $300 Million Contract With The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.”** According to the Washington Post, “For the sprawling effort to restore Puerto Rico’s crippled electrical grid, the territory’s state-owned utility has turned to a two-year-old company from Montana that had just two full-time employees on the day Hurricane Maria made landfall. The company, Whitefish Energy, said last week that it had signed a $300 million contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to repair and reconstruct large portions of the island’s electrical infrastructure. The contract is the biggest yet issued in the troubled relief effort.

##### *Zinke’s Office Said He Had No Role In Whitefish Securing The Contract*

**Zinke’s Office Said He Had No Role In Whitefish Securing The Contract.** According to the Washington Post, “Whitefish Energy is based in Whitefish, Mont., the home town of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Its chief executive, Andy Techmanski, and Zinke acknowledge knowing one another — but only, Zinke’s office said in an email, because Whitefish is a small town where ‘everybody knows everybody.’ One of Zinke’s sons ‘joined a friend who worked a summer job’ at one of Techmanski’s construction sites, the email said. Whitefish said he worked as a ‘flagger.’ Zinke’s office said he had no role in Whitefish securing the contract for work in Puerto Rico.

Everyone around this table, and everyone watching, can be very proud of what’s taking place in Puerto Rico.’ While Trump bragged about the official number of dead, the final death toll will likely turn out to be higher. Poor communication services have hindered reporting, and current living conditions on the island could jeopardize more lives, especially those of the sick and the elderly.” [Huffington Post, [10/3/17](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-visits-puerto-rico_n_59d3640de4b0655781554854)]

### **In The Aftermath Of Hurricane Harvey, Trump’s Response Was Criticized As Lacking Empathy**

**Kenneth T. Walsh: Trump’s Response To Hurricane Harvey Revealed An “Empathy Gap.”** According to U.S. News and World Report, “[Trump] is showing an empathy gap […] But so far he hasn't provided the emotional connection that many Americans would like to see, such as personally comforting people at their moment of need and citing some of the many cases of heroism by first responders and everyday people helping each other. On Tuesday, the president visited two crisis centers in Texas and talked with federal, state and local officials about making the rescue, relief and recovery efforts as effective as possible. He didn't meet, at least publicly, with hurricane victims as other presidents have done under similar circumstances but emphasized how well things were going overall. In Corpus Christi, he said, ‘We want to do it better than ever before.’ He addressed a crowd outside a firehouse where he had been briefed as if he were attending a rally. ‘What a crowd!’ he declared. ‘What a turnout!’” [U.S. News And World Report – Op-Ed – Kenneth T.

There was something missing from what President Trump said. That's the empathy for the people who suffer.’ Trump aides say he is being careful to avoid diverting resources from where they are needed most, and that's why he didn't go to Houston, where the worst damage has occurred.” [U.S. News And World Report – Op-Ed – Kenneth T.
