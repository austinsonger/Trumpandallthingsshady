**Trump Sought To Find Ways To Limit Federal Support From Going To Puerto Rico With A Senior Administration Official Claim That “He Doesn’t Want Another Single Dollar Going To The Island.”** According to the Washington Post, “After initially vowing to reject the food-stamp funding, President Trump has agreed to the emergency request to help Senate Republicans pass a broader disaster-relief package, which may be taken up for a vote this week. But at an Oval Office meeting on Feb. 22, Trump asked top advisers for ways to limit federal support from going to Puerto Rico, believing it is taking money that should be going to the mainland, according to senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of the president’s private remarks […] Trump has also privately signaled he will not approve any additional help for Puerto Rico beyond the food-stamp money, setting up a congressional showdown with Democrats who have pushed for more expansive help for the island. A senior administration official with direct knowledge of the meeting described Trump’s stance: ‘He doesn’t want another single dollar going to the island.’” [Washington Post, [3/25/19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/puerto-rico-faces-food-stamps-crisis-as-trump-privately-vents-about-federal-aid-to-hurricane-maria-battered-island/2019/03/25/ade500fe-4cb3-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd_story.html)]

**Texas Lawmaker Garnet Coleman: “I Didn’t Know Disasters Made Money For People.”** According to Dallas News, “Trump meant it as a joke. But one Houston state lawmaker is not laughing. ‘I didn’t know disasters made money for people,’ said Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat. ‘It’s insensitive to think there is a silver lining in a disaster when people still cannot get back in their homes.’ Coleman went further and said the money is not enough and is not getting to Texas fast enough. ‘The pledge of those dollars from the federal government, it’s late,’ he said.” [Dallas News, [10/18/19](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/10/18/trump-texas-made-fortune-after-hurricane-harvey/)]

#### **Trump Used A Marker To Falsely Exaggerate The Path Of Hurricane Dorian**

**Trump Used A Marker To Exaggerate The Path Of Hurricane Dorian.** According to Vox, “President Donald Trump, after being criticized for his untrue statements that Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian, displayed an altered version of an official government map of the storm’s path — promoting what appears to have been someone in the White House’s casual violation of federal law. Weather reporters and experts noticed the alteration on a White House video of Trump discussing the storm, which has killed seven people in the Bahamas and is likely to cost the Caribbean country billions of dollars. In it, the black marker half-circle extends the actual forecast of the storm’s path into the southeastern corner of Alabama. Weather.com’s Kait Parker noted this was also a ‘very outdated’ graphic.” [Vox, [9/4/19](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/4/20849909/trump-hurricane-dorian-alabama-map)]

##### *Trump Sought Support For His Statement Even Though It Contradicted The National Weather Service* 

**The NOAA Released A Statement Supporting Trump And Contracting The National Weather Service Claim That Alabama Would Not Be Impacted.** According to the Guardian, “But the president has been adamant throughout the week that he was correct, and the White House has deployed government resources and staff to back him. The latest defense came out on Friday evening, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement from an unidentified spokesman stating that information provided by Noaa and the National Hurricane Center to the president had demonstrated that ‘tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.’ The advisories were dated from last Wednesday, 28 August, through Monday, the statement read. The statement also said the Birmingham NWS tweet on Sunday morning ‘spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.’ The statement from Noaa contrasts with comments the agency’s spokesman, Chris Vaccaro, made last Sunday. ‘The current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama,’ Vaccaro said at the time.” [Guardian, [9/7/19](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/sharpiegate-trump-alabama-hurricane-dorian)]

**Industry Experts Called The NOAA Statement “So Disappointing” And “Utterly Disgusting.”** According to the Guardian, “The former National Hurricane Center director Bill Read blasted Noaa leadership on Friday night on his Facebook page calling the situation ‘so disappointing’ and saying he would comment because Noaa employees were ordered to be quiet. ‘Either NOAA Leadership truly agrees with what they posted or they were ordered to do it. If it is the former, the statement shows a lack of understanding of how to use probabilistic forecasts in conjunction with other forecast information. Embarrassing. If it is the latter, the statement shows a lack of courage on their part by not supporting the people in the field who are actually doing the work. Heartbreaking,’ Read wrote. Dan Sobien, president of the union representing weather service employees, tweeted on Friday: ‘Let me assure you the hard working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight.’” [Guardian, [9/7/19](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/sharpiegate-trump-alabama-hurricane-dorian)] 

#### **Alabama Was Spared By Hurricane Dorian**

**Alabama Was Spared By Hurricane Dorian.** According to Politico, “Alabama was spared, but Dorian could still wreak havoc. As of midafternoon Thursday, the center of Dorian was located about 60 miles south of Myrtle Beach, S.C., or 110 miles south-southeast of Wilmington, N.C. The center of Dorian has thus far remained just offshore, but the storm is still lashing the Southeastern coast with dangerous storm surge, damaging winds, heavy rain and tornadoes. Dorian is now headed toward the vulnerable Outer Banks of North Carolina, which are sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pamlico and Albermarle sounds to the west.” [Politico, [9/5/19](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/05/donald-trump-hurricane-dorian-alabama-1482815)]

#### **It Was A Federal Crime To Provide False Weather Forecasts** 

**It Was A Federal Crime To Provide False Weather Forecasts, But Trump Enjoyed Protections As President.** According to Politico, “And as part of that role, Congress passed a law that makes it illegal to pass along a false forecast as an official Weather Service project. According to federal law, ‘Whoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.’ The Justice Department says the president can’t be indicted for violating federal law, and it’s unlikely a doctored weather map would result in the kind of special counsel investigation that dogged Trump’s presidency over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.” [Politico, [9/5/19](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/05/donald-trump-hurricane-dorian-alabama-1482815)]
